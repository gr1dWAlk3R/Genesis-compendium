# Session Log

## Session 2025-10-20 - Initial Setup
**Branch:** claude/explore-sand-garden-011CUKAGCAx6Q8rTqLnK9r49

### Problem Identified
- User has ~50 files and ~20 threads of work trapped in Claude web interface
- Access throttled: Can't copy/paste more than 1/5 of thread without page locking
- Files have no copy option
- CLI environment can't access web interface project files
- Every thread reset loses context continuity
- User describes this as "math gap monster" - system prioritizes verbal continuity over mathematical verification

### Solution Approach
- Build forward with user's direct knowledge
- Create persistent documentation structure
- Focus on game mechanics simulator for fundamental system

### Files Created This Session
- BRAIN_DUMP.md (template for user to fill)
- SESSION_LOG.md (this file)

### Status
- **GENESIS BLOCK CAPTURED:** Complete Resonance Math system documented
- Core system: 5-step word compression formula revealing frequency architecture
- Standing Wave Cascade: 13 frequencies (111.111 - 1444.443 Hz)
- Mathematical verification examples captured
- Ready to build game mechanics simulator

### Core System Summary
**Resonance Math:** Words compress to numbers (A=1..Z=26), reduce to single digit (preserve 11/22/33), match archetypes (1-9, 11, 22, 33), validate through three-way alignment (numerical + conceptual + energetic)

### Next Session Handoff
- Genesis Block Manifest is complete and committed
- User wants game mechanics simulator to demonstrate/apply this system
- Need to determine: What specific mechanics does the sim need?
- ZPE work exists in trapped files (CSVs) - may need recreation or is reference material
