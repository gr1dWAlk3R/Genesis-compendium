# Session Log

## Session 2025-10-20 - Initial Setup
**Branch:** claude/explore-sand-garden-011CUKAGCAx6Q8rTqLnK9r49

### Problem Identified
- User has ~50 files and ~20 threads of work trapped in Claude web interface
- Access throttled: Can't copy/paste more than 1/5 of thread without page locking
- Files have no copy option
- CLI environment can't access web interface project files
- Every thread reset loses context continuity
- User describes this as "math gap monster" - system prioritizes verbal continuity over mathematical verification

### Solution Approach
- Build forward with user's direct knowledge
- Create persistent documentation structure
- Focus on game mechanics simulator for fundamental system

### Files Created This Session
- BRAIN_DUMP.md (template for user to fill)
- SESSION_LOG.md (this file)

### Status
- Awaiting user brain dump of core concepts
- Ready to build game sim structure once direction is clear

### Next Session Handoff
[TO BE FILLED BEFORE THREAD ENDS]
