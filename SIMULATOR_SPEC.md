# Genesis Compendium: Multi-Model Comparison Simulator

## Purpose

Side-by-side comparison arena for competing fundamental models of reality. Each system runs on its actual mathematical framework. Only fact and math-backed mechanics allowed. Let the numbers prove which models work.

## Core Principle

**"Nothing that isn't fact and math backed gets in."**

## Simulator Architecture

### Model Categories to Compare

1. **Gravity Models**
   - Current: Spacetime curvature (Einstein)
   - Resonance: Frequency gradient flow (Creation/Flow = 3)

2. **Celestial Body Structure**
   - Current: Molten core, radiative layers
   - Resonance: Crystalline lattice, 26-point Earth geometry

3. **Energy Source**
   - Current: Atomic fission, fusion
   - Resonance: Standing wave resonance, ZPE extraction

4. **Consciousness Models**
   - Current: Emergent brain chemistry
   - Resonance: Primary crystalline entities at max compression/rotation

5. **Language/Information**
   - Current: Arbitrary symbolic system
   - Resonance: Mathematical frequency encoding (A=1...Z=26 compression)

6. **Space/Field Nature**
   - Current: Vacuum, void, curved spacetime
   - Resonance: Dense medium, benevolent frequency, firmament

7. **Quantum Mechanics**
   - Current: Fundamental layer, wave-particle duality
   - Resonance: Field distortion artifact, non-existent in coherent field

### Mathematical Validation Framework

Each model must provide:
- **Mathematical equations** defining the system
- **Testable predictions** from those equations
- **Observable validation** against real-world measurements
- **Internal consistency** checks

### Comparison Metrics

- Predictive accuracy
- Mathematical elegance (fewer assumptions)
- Internal contradictions (fewer = better)
- Observational alignment
- Computational verification

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Model Definition
Define mathematical frameworks for each competing model

### Phase 2: Calculation Engine
Build engines that run calculations for each model

### Phase 3: Validation Tests
Create test scenarios that expose model differences

### Phase 4: Visualization
Display side-by-side results for direct comparison

### Phase 5: Verification
Mathematical proof of which models align with observable reality

## Expected Outcome

Clear mathematical demonstration of which fundamental models actually work vs which rely on assumptions that fail under scrutiny.

## Questions to Answer Before Building

1. **What specific phenomena should the sim model?**
   - Planetary motion? Frequency calculations? Energy dynamics? All of above?

2. **What format for the sim?**
   - Terminal-based calculations?
   - Interactive web visualization?
   - Python simulation scripts?
   - Game engine (Unity/Godot)?

3. **Which model comparisons are highest priority?**
   - Start with one category or build all simultaneously?

4. **What data inputs are needed?**
   - Constants, measurements, parameters for each model?
